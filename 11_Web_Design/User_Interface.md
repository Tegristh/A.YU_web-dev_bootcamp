*** we are always dranw to the bigger bolder square of things. ***

We can use that and other tricks in User Interface

## Hierarchy

    - By Size (The bigger is more important)
    - By Colour (If an element's colour is standoutish, it's more important)

## Layout

    - a good line leght is aroud 40 to 60 characters per line.

## Alignment

    - Less alignment point create Stronger alignment point. Strong alignment point good!
    - Less is better!

## White Space

    - more space is the way to go!

## Audience
